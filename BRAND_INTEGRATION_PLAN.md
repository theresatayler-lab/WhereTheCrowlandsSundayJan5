## Design Direction Based on Your Images

### Color Scheme Adjustment Needed:
Your images are **black and white woodcuts** - they need a lighter background!

**Recommended Background Colors:**
```css
Option 1: Weathered Parchment
background: #e8dcc8 (cream/parchment)
text: #1a1410 (dark brown)
accents: #750609 (blood red), #06133c (midnight blue)

Option 2: Aged Paper
background: #d8cbb8 (weathered beige - your brand color!)
text: #2a2520 (warm dark)
accents: #750609, #06133c

Option 3: Light Warm Grey
background: #e0d5c7
text: #1C1C1C (raven black)
accents: #750609, #06133c
```

**Why lighter background?**
- Your engravings are BLACK on WHITE originally
- They'll pop beautifully on cream/parchment
- Creates "ancient grimoire" aesthetic
- More authentic to historical occult books

### Where Each Image Will Go:

#### Hero Section (Home Page)
**Use**: Mystical landscape (Image 1)
- Large background with overlay
- Text overlaid on the winding river
- Creates journey metaphor
- Adds depth and mystery

#### Navigation/Logo Area
**Use**: Crow with triangle or crow with flowers
- Replace moon icon with one of these crows
- Detailed enough for small size
- Recognizable silhouette

#### Section Headers
**Use**: Crow with flowers, crow in flight
- Between major sections
- As decorative breaks
- Page headers for different areas

#### Card Decorations
**Use**: Small engraving details
- Corner ornaments
- Border elements
- Background textures

#### Persona System (Future)
**Use**: Different crow poses + figure engravings
- Each persona gets their own engraving
- Circular crow for ceremonial magician
- Figure with animals for hedge witch
- Etc.

### Typography Update
Your images suggest we should use fonts that match the engraving aesthetic:

**Current:**
- Italiana (elegant serif) ✓ Works
- Cinzel Decorative (ornate) ✓ Works
- Montserrat (modern sans) ✗ Too modern

**Recommended:**
- **Headings**: Keep Italiana or switch to **IM Fell English** (period-appropriate)
- **Body**: Switch to **Crimson Text** or **Libre Baskerville** (bookish, readable)
- **Accents**: Keep Cinzel Decorative for mystical elements

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Background & Colors (Do Now)
1. Switch to lighter background (weathered beige #D8CBB3)
2. Adjust text to dark brown/black
3. Keep blood red and midnight blue as accents
4. Test with your engraving images

### Phase 2: Hero Integration (After logos)
1. Use mystical landscape as hero background
2. Add parchment texture overlay
3. Position "Where The Crow Lands" text
4. Ensure readability with semi-transparent overlay

### Phase 3: Navigation (After logos)
1. Replace moon icon with crow logo you'll provide
2. Or use one of the crow engravings as placeholder
3. Adjust sizing for navigation bar
4. Ensure works in both header and mobile

### Phase 4: Decorative Elements
1. Add crow engravings as section breaks
2. Use as page headers
3. Add to card corners
4. Create border patterns from line work

### Phase 5: Content Pages
1. Different engraving for each section
2. Mystical landscape for timeline
3. Figure engravings for historical figures
4. Crow images for deities/rituals

## Immediate Actions Needed:

### 1. Background Color Decision
**Which do you prefer?**
- A) Weathered Beige (#D8CBB3) - your brand color, warm
- B) Lighter Parchment (#e8dcc8) - more contrast
- C) Aged Paper (#f5eee0) - lightest, most readable

### 2. Logo Clarification
**What's your actual logo?**
- Is it one of these crow engravings?
- Do you have a separate logo file?
- Should I use the "crow with flowers" as the logo?
- Or the "crow in triangle"?

### 3. Typography
**Keep current fonts or switch to match engravings?**
- Current (elegant) works okay
- Period fonts (IM Fell, Crimson Text) match better
- Your choice!

## Technical Notes

### Image Optimization:
- Your engravings are high quality
- Need to optimize for web (reduce file size)
- Create SVG versions where possible
- Multiple sizes for responsive design

### Usage Strategy:
- **Full size**: Hero backgrounds
- **Medium**: Section headers (500-800px wide)
- **Small**: Icons, decorative elements (100-200px)
- **Tiny**: Patterns, textures (tiled)

## Next Steps:

1. **You upload**: Logo files (the actual Where The Crow Lands logo)
2. **I adjust**: Background to lighter color for engravings
3. **I integrate**: Your images throughout the site
4. **You review**: See mockup and approve direction
5. **I finalize**: Full implementation
