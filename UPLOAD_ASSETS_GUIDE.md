## Background Adjustment

I just lightened the background from pure black (#1C1C1C) to a warmer dark brown (#2a2520).

If you want it even lighter or different, tell me:
- "Lighter" → I'll make it more visible
- "Different tone" → More brown? More grey? More purple?
- "Show me your brand images first" → Then I'll match exactly
