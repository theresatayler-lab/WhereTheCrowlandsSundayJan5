    bio: `Sheila "Shiggy" Tayler was the matriarch who wove together family secrets, poetry, and psychic intuition in post-war London. Raised amid rationing and the chaos of WWII, she survived bombings and loss, yet found solace in birdsong and the pages of the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyam. Her life was a dance of memory—both lost and fiercely protected. Shiggy's rituals blend the practical courage of Churchill's Home Guard, the psychic traditions of wartime spiritualism, and the poetic wisdom of her favorite verses. She guarded family truths, using the "veil spell" to shield and guide future generations. Her empathy ran deep, her wit was sharp, and her belief in the magic of the ordinary never faded.`,
